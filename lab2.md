#  Shell Scripting Tutorial!!

Shell scripting allows you to **automate tasks** in Linux/Unix by writing commands inside a file that the shell executes line by line.

---

## 1. ðŸ”¹ What is a Shell Script?

* A **shell** is a command-line interpreter (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, `sh`).
* A **shell script** is a text file with a series of commands.
* File usually has **`.sh`** extension, though not mandatory.

**Example: `hello.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Run it:

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh   # make it executable
./hello.sh
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## 2. ðŸ”¹ Variables

Variables store data (text, numbers, paths, etc.).

### Defining variables

```bash
name="saloni"
age=19
```

 No spaces around `=`.

### Accessing variables

```bash
echo "My name is $name and I am $age years old."
```

Output:

```
My name is saloni and I am 19 years old.
```

### Environment variables

```bash
echo $HOME   # home directory
echo $USER   # current user
echo $PWD    # present working directory
```

---

## 3. ðŸ”¹ User Input

Read input from user with `read`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your favorite language:"
read lang
echo "You chose $lang"
```

---

## 4. ðŸ”¹ Conditional Statements (if-else)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
num=10

if [ $num -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 5"
else
    echo "Number is less than or equal to 5"
fi
```

Operators:

* `-eq` (equal)
* `-ne` (not equal)
* `-gt` (greater than)
* `-lt` (less than)
* `-ge` (greater or equal)
* `-le` (less or equal)

## 5. ðŸ”¹ Loops

### For loop

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

Or use a range:

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### While loop

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))   # increment
done
```

### Until loop

Runs until condition becomes true.

```bash
x=1
until [ $x -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Value: $x"
    ((x++))
done
```

## 6. ðŸ”¹ Functions

Encapsulate reusable code.

```bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1"
}

greet saloni
greet World
```

```
Hello, saloni
Hello, World
```

## 7. ðŸ”¹ Command Line Arguments

Access arguments passed to script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```

Run:

```bash
./script.sh apple banana
```

Output:

```
Script name: ./script.sh
First argument: apple
Second argument: banana
All arguments: apple banana
Number of arguments: 2
```

## 8. ðŸ”¹ Arrays

```bash
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")

echo "First fruit: ${fruits[0]}"

for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
    echo "Fruit: $fruit"
done
```

## 9. ðŸ”¹ Useful Commands in Scripts

* `date` â†’ show current date/time
* `whoami` â†’ show current user
* `ls` â†’ list files
* `pwd` â†’ print working directory
* `cat` â†’ read file contents

## 10. ðŸ”¹ A Practical Example

**Backup script (`backup.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup home directory to /tmp

backup_file="/tmp/home_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tar.gz"

tar -czf $backup_file $HOME

echo "Backup saved to $backup_file"
```

Run:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

### EXTRA QUESTIONS
* 1. What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script?
purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script is:
The line #!/bin/bash at the top of a script is called a shebang (or hashbang). Its purpose is to tell the operating system which interpreter to use to run the script.

Hereâ€™s what it does in detail:

#! indicates the start of the interpreter path.

/bin/bash specifies the full path to the Bash shell.

When you run the script as an executable (e.g., ./script.sh), the system looks at the shebang line to know it should use Bash (located at /bin/bash) to execute the commands inside the script.

Without the shebang, the script might be run by the default shell, which could be something else (like sh or dash), potentially causing errors if the script uses Bash-specific features.

In short:
#!/bin/bash ensures your script runs using Bash.


* 2. How do you make a script executable?
To make a script executable, you use the chmod command to change its permissions.

Hereâ€™s how you do it:

chmod +x script.sh


chmod = change mode (permissions)

+x = add execute permission

script.sh = your script file

After running this, you can execute the script directly like this:

./script.sh
